# Skiper

initially i had no idea on what to build, just that i'll be using some cool UI library (for which i settled with Skiper). and after collecting some feedback here are the points I received.

1. must be a japense stationary product or brand
2. use handwriting font from google
3. divide the site into multiple sections
4. creative components
5. japense sliding text somewhere on the site
6. white bg as it blends well with stationary theme
